# Infrastructure Setup Summary - AI Mini Games

## Current Status: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL (Emergency Mode)

### What's Working
- **Emergency Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:8000
  - Health endpoint: http://localhost:8000/health
  - Basic CORS configured for mobile app
  - Status: RUNNING âœ“

### What's NOT Working
- **Docker**: Not installed (CRITICAL)
- **PostgreSQL**: Not available
- **Redis**: Not available
- **Full Backend Features**: Disabled due to missing dependencies

### Files Created for Infrastructure
1. **`/Users/by/AIMiniGames/infrastructure_setup.sh`**
   - Automated setup script for macOS
   - Checks for Docker, installs local alternatives if needed
   - Run with: `./infrastructure_setup.sh`

2. **`/Users/by/AIMiniGames/start_dev_services.py`**
   - Python script to detect and start available services
   - Falls back to local services if Docker unavailable
   - Run with: `python3 start_dev_services.py`

3. **`/Users/by/AIMiniGames/run_backend_minimal.py`**
   - Minimal backend with SQLite fallback
   - Creates in-memory storage for testing
   - Run with: `python3 run_backend_minimal.py`

4. **`/Users/by/AIMiniGames/emergency_backend.py`**
   - Complete emergency API with all endpoints
   - No database (uses in-memory storage)
   - Run with: `python3 emergency_backend.py`

### Immediate Action Required

#### Install Docker Desktop (PRIORITY 1)
```bash
# macOS Installation
1. Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Install the .dmg file
3. Launch Docker Desktop
4. Wait for Docker to fully start
5. Verify: docker --version
```

#### After Docker Installation
```bash
# Start all services
make start
# OR
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Current Workaround
The emergency backend is running with limited functionality:
- URL: http://localhost:8000
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
- Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs (if available)

### Limitations in Emergency Mode
- No data persistence (everything is in memory)
- No real authentication (tokens are fake)
- No AI generation capabilities
- No file uploads
- No WebSocket connections
- Data lost on server restart

### Mobile App Connection
The mobile frontend can connect to the emergency backend at:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- API Version: `/api/v1`

However, most features will not work properly without the database.

### Coordination Status
Updated `/Users/by/AIMiniGames/coordination.json`:
```json
{
  "infrastructure_status": {
    "docker_available": false,
    "services_running": ["FastAPI (emergency mode - no database)"],
    "issues": [
      "Docker not installed - CRITICAL",
      "PostgreSQL not available",
      "Redis not available",
      "Running in emergency mode with limited functionality"
    ],
    "mode": "emergency",
    "api_url": "http://localhost:8000"
  }
}
```

### Resolution Path
1. **Install Docker Desktop** (essential)
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services
3. Verify with `make health-check`
4. Full backend will be available at http://localhost:8000
5. Mobile app can then connect with full functionality

### Contact
If Docker installation is blocked by system permissions:
1. Check with system administrator for Docker installation approval
2. Alternative: Use cloud-based development environment (GitHub Codespaces, GitPod)
3. Last resort: Deploy to cloud service (AWS, GCP, Azure) for development
