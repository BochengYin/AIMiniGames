# Task: Create Claude Hooks for AI Mini Games Project

**Started:** 2025-01-25
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Planning

## Objective
Create a comprehensive list of Claude hooks that will automate common development workflows and enforce best practices for the AI Mini Games dual-stack platform (Flutter + FastAPI).

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Understanding of Claude Code hooks system
- [ ] Analysis of common development tasks in this project
- [ ] Review of existing project structure and workflows

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Research Claude Code hook types and capabilities
2. [ ] Identify common development workflows that could benefit from automation
3. [ ] Design hooks for both Flutter and Python/FastAPI development
4. [ ] Create hooks for project-specific patterns (Clean Architecture, feature modules)
5. [ ] Add hooks for testing, linting, and code quality
6. [ ] Create hooks for documentation and planning workflows
7. [ ] Test and validate each hook

## Files to be Modified
- `.claude/hooks/` - New directory for hook definitions
- Various hook files for different automation tasks

## Hook Categories to Create

### 1. Project Management Hooks
- **Task Planning Hook** - Automatically create task files in `.claude/tasks/`
- **Progress Tracking Hook** - Update task status and implementation logs
- **Handover Documentation Hook** - Generate completion summaries

### 2. Code Quality Hooks
- **Pre-commit Hook** - Run linters, formatters, tests before commits
- **Code Review Hook** - Check for common patterns and best practices
- **Architecture Validation Hook** - Ensure Clean Architecture compliance

### 3. Flutter-Specific Hooks
- **Flutter Feature Generator Hook** - Create feature module structure
- **Widget Testing Hook** - Generate test templates for new widgets
- **Riverpod Provider Hook** - Create provider boilerplate with best practices

### 4. FastAPI-Specific Hooks
- **API Endpoint Hook** - Generate route, schema, and test templates
- **Database Model Hook** - Create SQLAlchemy models with migrations
- **Feature Module Hook** - Generate complete feature structure

### 5. Full-Stack Integration Hooks
- **API Client Generator Hook** - Generate Flutter API client from FastAPI routes
- **End-to-End Test Hook** - Create integration test templates
- **Documentation Sync Hook** - Keep API docs and mobile docs in sync

### 6. Development Workflow Hooks
- **Environment Setup Hook** - Validate dev environment is properly configured
- **Service Health Check Hook** - Verify all services are running
- **Deployment Preparation Hook** - Run pre-deployment checks

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test each hook individually
- [ ] Test hook interactions and conflicts
- [ ] Validate generated code follows project patterns
- [ ] Ensure hooks work with existing Makefile commands

## Risks and Considerations
- **Hook Complexity** - Keep hooks simple and focused on single responsibilities
- **Performance Impact** - Ensure hooks don't slow down development workflow
- **Maintenance** - Create hooks that are easy to update as project evolves
- **Documentation** - Each hook needs clear usage instructions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete set of hooks covering major development workflows
- [ ] All hooks tested and validated
- [ ] Documentation for each hook with usage examples
- [ ] Integration with existing development commands (Makefile)
- [ ] Hooks follow established project patterns and conventions
